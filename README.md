# p5.js + socket.io Template
This is a template to create multiplayer programs running off of a node.js server
using socket.io for the websocket connection and p5/p5.play to handle the visuals of the game.

## Editing
There are two main files you will need to edit.
1. `index.js` This is the server-side code.
2. `public/sketch.js` Client-side sketch file to handle your game sprites and animations.
